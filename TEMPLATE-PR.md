# CHAPTER X.x - Firstname Lastname

## Triumphs

Reflect on 2-3 triumphs in the list format below.

## Triumphs

1. **Relative Path Win**: I placed my screenshot in `src/assets/images/yourfilehere.png` and embedded it with `![...](../assets/images/yourfilehere.png)`. I learned how `..` moves me up from `00-Getting-Started` to `src`, then down into `assets/images`.

2. **Dual Chapter Links**: I added links to the command-line chapter as both `.md` and `.html` (`./03-cmd-line.md` and `./03-cmd-line.html`). I learned that `.md` opens in VS Code preview while `.html` is what the built site uses.


## Questions / Difficulties

1. **“Copy Relative Path” vs Markdown Paths**: VS Code’s “Copy Relative Path” gives me `src/...`, but my Markdown needs the path from the current file, so I have to drop `src/` and prepend `../`. Is there a faster trick or extension to avoid this adjustment?
