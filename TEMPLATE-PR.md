# CHAPTER X.x - Firstname Lastname

## Triumphs

Reflect on 2-3 triumphs in the list format below.

1. **Outputting Array Length**: I figured out the random “7” wasn’t a bug—sex.push("unknown") returns the new length of the array, so the cell was displaying 7 as the result. Wrapping it in an if check (and outputting sex separately) prevented duplicates and showed only the updated list, exactly as I expected.


## Questions / Difficulties

1. **Steep Curve**: Not neccessarily a question but getting a hang of this was really tough. As it is, I don't think I am versed yet even. I will definitely need a lot more practice.
