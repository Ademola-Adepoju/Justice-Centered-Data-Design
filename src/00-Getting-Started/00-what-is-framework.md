# 00-What is Observable Framework?

Observable Framework — or “Framework” for short — is an open-source static-site generator for data apps.

By *data app* we mean an application that is primarily a display of data. Data apps help you derive insights (to understand) and evaluate potential decisions (to take action).

A data app might be a set of coordinated **interactive visualizations** for your own or your community's “self-service” analysis. For example, you can explore a computational model or to investigate activity like Taxi rides in NYC;

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/mosaic.webp" style="width:100%"/>
  <figcaption class="small arrow">
    <a href="https://observablehq.com/framework/lib/mosaic" target="_blank">Taxi rides in New York City</a>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Or, you might create a **live dashboard** that places current events in the context of recent or historical trends;

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/getting-started/hello-plot.webp" style="width:100%" />
  <figcaption class="small arrow">
    <a href="https://observablehq.observablehq.cloud/framework-example-plot/">Observable Plot downloads</a>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

… or a **point-in-time report** that combines graphics and prose to present in-depth analysis, perhaps with recommendations or hypotheses about observed behavior;

  <figcaption class="small arrow">

  </figcaption>
</figure>

… or any number of other quantitative displays.

Data apps are useful in almost every domain, whether business intelligence, product analytics, monitoring operations, scientific reporting, and more. We're going to explore and experiment with its role for technical communicators who take seriously their commitment to advocacy work—both those specifically trained in TPC or those whose professions communicate complexity. Overall, let's have fun learning OF data apps for TPC, so we can dream together how they can be our tools for critical thinking and advocacy by enabling you to answer questions, explore possibilities, organize knowledge, and communicate insights.

## 0.0.1 Why JavaScript & Observable?

Why learn JavaScript within the context of Observable Framework? Because JS is flexible, which means you and your community can maintain careful and fair control over the data. Here are a few specific reasons.

<p class="drop_case_first_letter">
  1 Good data apps are highly customized. They present an opinionated perspective and forward your community's goals. Point-and-click tools may be easy to use at first glance. But, such tools suffer from limited expressivity and power. By learning how to read, write, and design data with code, you can begin to open up the types of questions you want and need to pursue.

<p class="drop_case_first_letter">
  2 You have the flexibility to adapt projects to meet the needs of those you serve, because Observable is built with open web standards in mind. Framework is free and open-source, and projects are just local files, i.e., files on your personal computer. You can source, develop, and share insights locally and only amongst your peers, or you can open up certain aspects and publish it on the open web. You have the say here, and that matters!
</p>

<p class="drop_case_first_letter">
  3 Flexibility comes with the development of projects. Because it's just open code and data, you can easily slip Observable into your existing workflow. For example, you can use your preferred editor, source control, and code review system.
</p>

<p class="drop_case_first_letter">
  4 Polyglot meets the web. Most application frameworks focus on a single language, such as JavaScript, Python, or R. Framework is different. Framework is _polyglot_: it brings multiple languages together. This approach is especially valuable for data apps where data teams have preferred languages for data analysis but want the full power of JavaScript for interactive graphics.
</p>

<p class="drop_case_first_letter">
  5 Observable is an end-to-end solution. Well-designed tools let communicators focus on highly customizable workflows and communication design. Framework's defaults build on numerous years of foster a good user experience. You can also deploy Framework to Observable, so you can easily collaborate on data apps and securely share them with your team.

## Submission

Before moving onto the next section, respond to the following questions in the Moodle assignment for this chapter (0.0):

1. What are data apps?
2. What are your prior experiences with data apps and data in general?
3. What is Observable Framework and its main affordances?
4. What do you understand -- at this moment -- as the main goals of TPC? Where might data-driven work and OF fit into those goals?
