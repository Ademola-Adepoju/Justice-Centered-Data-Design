# 2.1-Why Statistics Are Important [to TPC]

## Start Your GH Workflow

Remember, before you start anything else, always follow this GH methodological workflow:

1. Create meaningful **branch** that uses the agreed upon naming scheme: `CHP/X.x--lastname`.
2. Practice the iterative process to **commit** and **push** regularly with meaningful **commit messages**.

## Overview

The *Statistics for Social Justice* book (S4SJ) is written directly to and for social workers—not TPC. However, throughout this course, I am asking us to translate concerns, issues, situations, and methods that we recognize as potentially overlapping and similar with TPC professionals or even be inspired to invent different and new issues and methods for TPC.

The first three readings set us down this inventive path for the future of TPC professionals to take up more data-driven, structural approaches to our work, ***or what could be our work***! Here's a basic rationale and use for each of the readings in the context of this course:

1. The S4SJ book provides us with the initial structure of concepts and statistical techniques to adapt into our own ***structural perspective*** to carry into and inform TPC.
2. Lindgren, Gerdes, and Lawrence discuss and define what they call a social justice ethic. They briefly survey the social justice turn in TPC, and its exigence in response to the myriad ways ethics have been conceptualized and operationalized in TPC's past. This book chapter can help us gain a sense for where TPC has been and where it is going with regards to social justice work.
3. Graham et al's article can serve as an initial bridge for us to see an earlier work that introduces a mixed-methods approach to TPC scholarly research. While I don't expect us to fully understand the entirety of their statistical research method yet, I hope that we can begin to discuss and understand their argument that blends a bit of both the S4SJ structural perspective and TPC's future with a social justice ethic.

With these goals for the texts in mind, please respond to the questions herein about the assigned readings.

## 1. Questions about "Why statistics are important"

### 1.1. Defining key terms

**Question**: Use the space below to define the provided key terms.

- According to the SFSJ authors, what are the main difference between **data** and **information**?: Data are raw scores or numbers collected through questionnaires and other methodology, while information is the outcome we get after analyzing and interpreting this data.
- **Variable**: A characteristic that varies such as gender, religion, age, and so on.
- **Constant**: A characteristic that remains the same for people or objects that are the focus of the research.
- **Conceptualization**: The process of deciding the meaning of a term or idea in the research, so that it is reusable by other people in future studies.
- **Operationalization**: This refers to how a concept is actually measured.
- **Nominal level of data**: This involves classifying observationsinto mutually exclusive categories in no particular order or rank.
- **Ordinal level of data**: Classifying observations according to a particular order or rank.
- **Interval level of data**: This is data with equal spacing between values but the zero isn't a true zero. 
- **Ratio level of data**: It's like interval data, but a true zero that explicitly means "nothing".

### 1.2. On positivism

**Question**: Describe how the S4SJ authors define and use the term **positivism**. How do they suggest it is different from **post-positivism**? According to the authors, why are both paradigms important to social workers? Now, how do you imagine it is important for TPC professionals?

The authors say positivism is a way of thinking that treats social behavior like science i.e., we can study them objectively with measurements and numbers. Positivists believe that only measurable things belong in science. On the other hand, post-positivism pushes this notion back, arguing that science often ignores people's voices, and that human experiences are too complex for only rigid experiments.

The authors also argue that social workers need both. Qualitative methods let us hear differnet voices, while quantitative gives us numbers that policy makers and the public take seriously. For me, this is what the public sees as "social evidence'.

For us TPC professionals, especially in the context of user experience, I think it's important in a similar way. Positivism gives us tools like usability tests, surverys, and data analysis to prove what works while post-positivism reminds us to listen to users' stories, their contexts, and lived experiences. Using both approaches helps us design communicaton that is clear, fair, and ultimately human-centered.
### 1.3. On the "*structural perspective*"

**Question**: Name and define the different parts of the ***structural perspective***. Be sure to cover the parts related practice and research.

The structural perspective considers the fact that people's problems emanate from bigger sociio-political and economic structures rather than just personal failings.

**Practice parts**:

1. Defence of the Client - standing up for clients' rights in oppressive systems.
2. Collectivization - Helping clients see they are not alone by connecting them with others.
3. Mateerialization - showing how problems like depression can be linked to material issues such as poverty and lack of housing.
4. Increasing Client Power in the Worker-Client Relationship - sharing information and avoiding jargon so clients feel in control.
5. Enhancing Client Power Through Personal Change - supporting slients in making changes while connecting those changes to their social context.

**Research parts**:

- Using statistics and studies to highlight structural issues like poverty and discrimination.
- Involving clients in research (participatory action research) so theri vouces shape their study.
- Using findings to push for structural changes, not just individual fixes.

## 2. Questions about "The history of empiricism"

### 2.1. On feminist empiricism

**Question**: According to the SFSJ authors, what is ***feminist empiricism***? And, what issues does it recognize as important to recognize and remedy? Be sure to discuss why it emphasizes the importance of critically reflecting on aspects of the ***context*** of empirical work.

Feminist empiricism, according to the text, is in accordance with the main ideas of traditional empiricism -- the idea that knowledge should come from direct observation and testing. However, they argue that science is not exactly free of values and that researchers are shaped by their culture, gender, and location. In turn, these factors influence how knowledge is created.

Feminist empiricism points out two big problems with traditional science. First is individualism (the belief that a "true knower" is complete free from society). Instead, feminist scholars argue that knowledge is built in communities and is always tied to social factors. The second issue it raises is the idea of the neutral, detached scientist. It challenges this by saying emotions, values, and experiences cannot be ignored because they actually shape (and enrich) research.

This approach recognizes important issues like sexism and androcentrism in science. It shows how women and other marginalized groups have often been left out of the research process and it calls for these voices to be included. It also requires us to reflect on the context of discovery, including thibgs like the research questions we ask and the frameworks we use in studies. Ignoring these can allow hidden biases to shape the whole process.

For me, my key takeaway here is that feminist empiricism enables researchers to be more self-aware. Nobody is free of bias and questioning how our position, values, and communities influence our work helps us conduct more inclusive research, especially when we are blind to our own bias.

## 3. Questions About "The future of ethics and social justice" in TPC

### 3.1. On the "*socially just ethic*"

**Question**: Name and define some of what you deem as the main different parts of the ***socially just ethic***. Be sure to discuss how it is different from other ethical approaches.

A socially just ethic means making ethical choices in ways that always center people who are most in need and most affected by injustuce. It differs from other approaches in the sense that it is often more collective and community-driven.

### 3.2. Defining critical issues

**Question**: Briefly define each of the critical issues discussed: Cultural Imperialism, Marginalization, and Intersectional Oppression

**Cultural Imperialsim**: This is when one culture forces itself on others, usually through colonization, slavery, and so on

**Marginalization**: This happens when certain groups are excluded from particiapting meaningfully in the society.

**Intersectional Oppression**: This explains how different forms of oppression like racism and sexism overlap and reinforce each other.

### 3.3. Defining the 3Ps to help us recognize oppression Question: Define each of the 3Ps below. Explain how each helps us recognize oppression.

**Power**: How laws and institutions organize who benefits and who gets left out. It shows us how this dominance is maintained across different societal systems.

**Privilege**: Unearned advantage that some people get due to their identity or social class.

**Positionalitye**: Who we are (race, gender, class, etc.) and how identities place us in relation to systems of power, and these identities can shift across contexts and ultimately shape our experiences of oppression and privilege.

### 3.4. Why an SJ ethic? Question: Why do Lindgren, Gerdes, and Lawrence position a "SJ ethic" as essential to the future of TPC? What types of problems does it help TPC tackle?

Lindgren, Gerdes, and Lawrence argue that a SJ ethic is essential because TPC work isn't neutral. Every decision, whether it is audience prioritization or choosing which technology to design, involves ethical choices. A SJ ethic pushes TPC work to go beyond efficiency but also challenge systems of oppression and to design communication that serves marginalized communities first.

## 4. Questions About "Statistical Genre Analysis" (SGA)

### 4.1. On "big" data

**Question**: How do Graham et al define and discuss what constitutes "big" data? How does their definition differ from what you have heard before you read this article?

Graham et al explain that "big" data is more than size. It's also about how complex and hard it is to process the data. It is also contextual to different fields. For big companies or institutions, big data could be trillions of records while in technical communication it could be something like hundreds of thousands of transcripts from interviews since it might be too much for usual TPC qualitative methods to handle.

I think the difference between my understanding of big data now and before is mainly "size." Big Data has always meant large amounts of data to me.

### 4.2. On SGA

**Question**: Summarize the following parts of SGA:

1. What TPC problems SGA addresses,
2. What data they used to demonstrate its potential,
3. What questions SGA data and methods enable TPC to ask, and
4. What methods it uses to do so.

**What TPC problems SGA addresses**
Usually, TPC studies focus on small sets of texts, making it hard to generalize findings. With SGA, researchers can study very large datasets and still pay attention to things like rhetorical patterns. This way, TPC scholars can answer bigger questions about inclusion.

**What data they used to demonstrate its potential**
The authors used transcripts from gthe FDA's Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC) meetings between 2009 and 2012, which amounted to around 150,000 pages of data. 

**3. What questions SGA data and methods enable TPC to ask**
With SGA, we are able to understand if including more patient representaives change the kinds of evidence presented? Do conflicts of interest among committee members affect voting outcomes? As well as understanding if different forms of reasoning make a difference in drug approval decisions?

## 5. "Science is a social endeavor."

**Question**: Discuss what this statement means to you. Then, discuss any connections, confusion, and/or questions that you recognize with a SJ ethic and structural perspective?

To me, “science is a social endeavor” means that science does not happen in isolation. It is shaped by people and the societies they live in. Human behavior, cultural values, race, gender, class, and belief systems all contribute to scientific practices. Too often, these influences are hidden or ignored, which can give the false impression that science is neutral when it is not.

The connection to a SJ ethic is that acknowledging the social nature of science is the first step toward making it more inclusive. If we want research and technical communication to center marginalized groups, we have to recognize how power and privilege shape the work from the beginning. A SJ ethic asks us to actively question whose voices are missing, whose knowledge is excluded, and how our methods can be redesigned to prioritize equity.

## 6. Translating the structural approach into TPC

**Question**: After considering all of these texts -- their exigencies, propositions, and methods -- translate Mullaly's broader definition of the *structural approach* and Moreau's *practice methods* in social work into the domain of TPC or humanist domain of work by putting them into conversation with Lindgren, Gerdes, and Lawrence's SJ ethic and Graham et al's statistical genre analysis. In other words, begin to develop your own structural perspective and set of practices that translates Moreau's 5 practices. Finally, add one new practice approach specific to TPC/your domain.

#### My structural perspective (UX + explainability)

I think of user experience (UX) as something that is never fully neutral. Interfaces always sit within legal, policy, and data systems that shape how power and access are distributed. From this view, the way communication is designed in products can either make systems clearer or more confusing, and in some cases even harmful. A structural perspective for UX, then, is about paying attention to the explainability gap—the distance between what an algorithm does and what a user can actually understand. This gap matters most in high-stakes situations like money, housing, health, or security, where people need to know what happened, why it happened, and what their options are. The U.S. AI Bill of Rights, with its focus on “notice and explanation,” makes this especially relevant. One way to approach this is to imagine combining participatory design that centers marginalized voices with broader methods like statistical genre analysis or equity testing that look at patterns across many texts. Taken together, these perspectives suggest a way of treating explanation not just as a feature, but as a form of justice work inside UX.

#### Translating Moreau’s 5 practices to explainability in UX

**Defense of the user in high-stakes flows**: In UX, defending the user means recognizing that systems/interfaces can create harm when outcomes are unclear and unchallengeable. A socially just approach treats explanation as central features to protect users' rights.

**Collective sense-making**: Collectivization translates into practices that value users’ shared experiences. Community panels and feedback loops create spaces where people most affected by decisions shape the language and design of explanations.

**Making systems legible**: Materialization becomes the work of turning hidden system patterns into visible and understandable parts of the interface. This includes plain-language disclosures and explanation of key factors are ways of making abstract algorithm rules actionable for users.

**Sharing control in the product-user relationship**: Give users some control through design practices that let them actively participate in their interactions. Features like clear consent choices, data review options, and accessible language can help redistribute control.

**Building capacity rather than dependence**: Design can provide tools like glossaries to explain key terms, examples that show how outcomes might change under different conditions, and ready-to-use templates for appeals. These resources give users practical skills they can carry into future interactions, making systems feel less overwhelming.

#### Additional UX-Specific practice

**Designing fair explanations**: In UX, explanations can be understood as patterns that repeat across systems e.g., decision notices, error messages, or appeal instructions. These patterns can be studied to see what kinds of reasoning they rely on and how well they serve different groups of users. Instead of only testing explanations for clarity in general, we can also test them for fairness and equity across communities. When we find gaps, the practice is to reshape the explanation itself, breaking from old patterns if needed, so that more people can genuinely understand and act on the information given to them.
