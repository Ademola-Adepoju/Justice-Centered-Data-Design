</div>

## Course Description

**How can technical and professional communicators advocate for justice-centered, anti-oppressive designs and uses of data?**

In *ENG 498/583 Justice-Centered Data Design in TPC*, we will interrogate how technical and professional communication (TPC) can influence, and are already influenced by, the design of data. We will learn theories of intersectionality, anti-oppressive perspectives and cases, and data-driven techniques as a response to recognizing how data is a key set of communication design practices for TPC to learn and wield for just structural change.

Data design is TPC because it is highly concerned with people (audience), goals (purpose), and technologies. TPC professionals have much to offer the necessary advocacy work needed in data-driven workplaces across industry, government, and nonprofit sectors. Yet, traditionally, our field has yet to standardize learning fundamental data-driven techniques that will better position us to make a difference in the workplace and in shaping policy and procedures.

## Learning Objectives

Due to the situation described above, we will achieve the following learning objectives, so TPC is better prepared to actively and confidently advocate for those who are not represented, misrepresented, and actively being harmed by data-driven science, engineering, and business strategies:

1. Explain theories of intersectionality in relation to data and empiricism;
2. Demonstrate foundational statistical analysis techniques through applied anti-oppressive cases;
3. Apply intersectionality to develop a strong hypothesis to test, report the results, and explain the study's constraints with an anti-oppresive, structural perspective.
4. Learn foundational coding, data, and visualization techniques using the JavaScript-based Observable Framework.

We will learn and apply integral theories about data and power via accompanying case studies and hands-on tutorials to help you learn fundamental approaches to finding, collecting, analyzing, and reporting data-driven stories about opaque social-technical systems.

The fields we'll draw from include technical communication, statistics and social science, and other branches of information sciences.

## Course Assumptions

### Don't code?

Not a problem! This course assumes you know nothing, emphasizes underlying principles, and uses plain-language ("pseudocode") explanations to accompany your learning of applying code.

### Don't know statistics?

Also not a problem! This course assumes you know nothing and walks through the fundamentals of data collection, processing, and analysis techniques through applied cases and reflections.
