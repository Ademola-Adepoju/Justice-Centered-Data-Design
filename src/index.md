## Course Description

**How can technical and professional communicators advocate for justice-centered, anti-oppressive designs and uses of data?**

In *ENG 498/583 Justice-Centered Data Design in TPC*, we will interrogate how technical and professional communication (TPC) can influence, and are already influenced by, the design of data. We will learn about the justice-turn in TPC, anti-oppressive perspectives and cases, and data-driven techniques as a response to recognizing how data is a key set of communication design practices for TPC to learn and wield for just structural change.

Data design is TPC because it is highly concerned with people (audience), goals (purpose), and technologies. TPC professionals have much to offer the necessary advocacy work needed in data-driven workplaces across industry, government, and nonprofit sectors. Yet, traditionally, our field has yet to standardize learning fundamental data-driven techniques that will better position us to make a difference in the workplace and in shaping policy and procedures. In this class, we will invent and speculate possibilities for the future of TPC. And, you will create your very own data application and report to add to your portfolio.

## Learning Objectives

Due to the situation described above, we will achieve the following learning objectives, so TPC is better prepared to actively and confidently advocate for those who are not represented, misrepresented, and actively being harmed by data-driven science, engineering, and business strategies:

1. Explain the justice-turn in TPC in relation to data and empiricism;
2. Demonstrate foundational statistical analysis techniques through applied cases, e.g., exploratory data analysis and textual analysis;
3. Learn foundational coding, data, and visualization techniques within the context of Observable Framework.
4. Apply a justice-centered approach to critique and reimagine an existing dataset.

We will learn and apply integral theories about data and power via accompanying case studies and hands-on tutorials to help you learn fundamental approaches to finding, collecting, analyzing, and reporting data-driven stories about opaque social-technical systems.

The fields we'll draw from include technical communication, statistics and social science, and other branches of information sciences.

## Course Assumptions

### Don't code?

Not a problem! This course assumes you know nothing, emphasizes underlying principles, and uses plain-language ("pseudocode") explanations to accompany your learning of applying code.

### Don't know statistics?

Also not a problem! This course assumes you know nothing and walks through the fundamentals of data collection, processing, and analysis techniques through applied cases and reflections.

We will also take time during class to review the materials and exercises together.

### Work Load

Students should expect to spend an average of 6 hours per week on this 3-credit course, outside of our regularly scheduled class.

## Texts

All readings available via Moodle.

## Technologies

All technologies are free.

- VS Code Editor
- Github account and Github Desktop application
- Other programming language technologies as we move forward

## Major Assignments

### Applied Exercises / Responses (35%)

- **Due**: Weekly
- **Individual or Group**: Individual
- **Deliverable**: Completed activity in Observable textbook.
- **Points**: 5-15 per activity

**Description**: We will be learning lots of new skills, so it is imperative that we practice, practice, practice. These weekly or daily exercises integrate new ideas and skills into your repertoire. They will typically be submitted via a Github link to your "pull request" on Moodle. Some exercises are worth more than others, due to their difficulty.

### JavaScript Midterm (15%)

- **Due**: Friday, 09/19/2025
- **Individual or Group**: Individual
- **Deliverable**: New page that demonstrates general JS fluency
- **Points**: 100 points

**Description**: Time to put all the pieces together by transforming a new dataset in multiple ways. This midterm's first draft is due, as noted above, on 9/19. But, you can revise it for full credit by the end of the semester. We will also take time in class to work through it, so you can ask help of your peers and myself.

### Participation (15%)

- **Due**: Midterm &amp; Final
- **Individual or Group**: Individual
- **Deliverable**: Reflective memo
- **Points**: 15 per memo

**Description**: Rationalize your participation grade with supporting evidence from your engagement in this course. You will also reflect on the experience by providing some basic feedback for me to consider.

### Final: Data Design (35%)

- **Due**: Monday, December 8th.
- **Individual or Group**: Group
- **Deliverables**:
    1. 100 points - Observable Framework data app
    2. 50 points - Project management via GH workflow and Google Sheet Project Tracker
- **Points**: 150

**Description**: In a group, your team will create a professional scenario with an existing public dataset and apply the techniques that we learned throughout the course to accomplish your set out goals with the data. You will create a new Observable Framework data app that demonstrates the following:

1. Appropriate choice of analysis techniques.
2. Appropriate use of visuals and tables to highlight certain points to your scenarios audience.
3. Reflection page that discusses the benefits and limitations of the data in your problem scenario, as well as what data would be needed to redress or understand any other issues. Finally, it asks what next steps you envision for TPC to continue this work in this domain.
